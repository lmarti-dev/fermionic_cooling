# What is this?
This repo implements well-known quantum cooling algorithms for fermionic Hamiltonians.


## Paper figures
The results were published in [this preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14506).

If you want to reproduce the figures, go over to paper/reproduce_graphs.py

Each function is named after a figure in the paper, just run it to get the figure. Some simulations might run a little slow. You will also need [qutlet](https://github.com/lmarti-dev/qutlet) which contains many utilities needed for general fermionic simulations.
